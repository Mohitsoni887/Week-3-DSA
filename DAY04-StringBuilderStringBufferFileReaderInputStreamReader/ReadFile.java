/*
 * FileReader Problem 1: Read a File Line by Line Using FileReader
Problem:
Write a program that uses FileReader to read a text file line by line and print each line to the console.
Approach:
Create a FileReader object to read from the file.
Wrap the FileReader in a BufferedReader to read lines efficiently.
Use a loop to read each line using the readLine() method and print it to the console.
Close the file after reading all the lines.
